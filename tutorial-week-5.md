####Tools with Terry

Today were going to talk a little about the command line. I'm going to teach you a few valuable tricks that could help smooth over a rough days work in the terminal. For example, have you ever been working in command line and you forgot a specific command you put in earlier, but your working at a fast pace and you dont have time to hit the up arrow a hundred times to look through previous typed commands. Maybe you started typing out a long mess and you just need to just start over. to be continued....

1. History - will give you a list of the history of commands you typed. 

2. Ctrl+U - clears the entire line so you can type in a completely new command.

Today I'm going to teach you a couple valuable tricks in command line that could help smooth over a rough days work. For example, have you ever been working and you forgot a specific command you put in earlier, but your working at a fast pace and you dont have time to hit the up arrow a hundred times to look through previous typed commands. Maybe you started typing out a long mess and you just need to just start over. Below are some answers for these scenarios.

1. History - will give you a list of the history of commands you typed. 

2. Ctrl+U - clears the entire line so you can type in a completely new command.

Because Im in a funny mood, Im going to teach you a "fun" trick if you would lie to talk to Virtual Psychotherapist!
type the following cammands into your terminal:

 * $ emacs 
 * at next screen hit the Escape key followed by capital X
 * then $ doctor and hit return
 
Then begin "typing" unload your problems and concerns to Eliza. If you wish to end your session just hit control+c

I know the last one wasnt much help in a working environment but it might help if you need a laugh.

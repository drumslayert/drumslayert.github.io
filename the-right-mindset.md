###The Right Mindset

  There are two basic kinds of mindset. The first one is a fixed mindset which says, you are just born with whatever
  gifts, talents and abilities you are going to have know matter how much effort you put in. The second one is the growth mindset that says, we all start at zero.  We all have the ability to learn anything if we are willing to put 
  forth effort, work hard, push and challange ourselves to grow. 
  
  I think I can recognize some characteristics from each mindset in myself. I can remember back over 20 years ago in highschool thinking, I can't really do any better than what Im doing.  I had to always work really hard to keep a good grade. Some of my calssmates that excelled with what seemed like no ir little effort made me jealous sometimes. 
Over the years Ive realized that if when I really want to learn something and set out to achieve that goal im reaching for.  I can learn how to do anything. Wether it's fixing my car when it breaks down, fixing that leak when a pipe bursts, welding or building a deck in my backyard. None of those things are easy but anyone can learn how to do them along with anything else. 

  With the growth mindset is what has brought me here tooday. I came to a place in my life realizing that I can achieve anything I want in life. I can put forth effort and challenge myself lo learn new things. Something I can enjoy working hard at. Having a family with a wife and 2 kids has a way of helping you grow, at least for some. I want to achieve more and more sucess each day and not only myself but for my family. I want to set an example that you can do anything you want in life if your willing to challenge yourself and put forth the effort to do it. You can set the tone for success within your household.

####JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
 
 OK so in my searchings around in the land of google, I came acroos this crazy long, very slow video that in the words of Tony Alicea "takes you under the hood of javascript". So it's probably not for everyone because most of it will feel like a review.  It is painfully slow, but I think slow was what I needed. It's helped me to grasp some things that I thought I understood but did not. Also has helped he understand some things Ive been strugling with. 
 I think the bigest things I've gained from watching this video are a better understanding of the context in which a program executes in a global environment. Also a better grasp on coercion and of how the javascript engine will coerce things in your code if they are not inexplicably defined. With that in mind could cause you a lot of headaches trying to work outthe bugs. So be intentional with every little detail in your code! So if I can say one thing to take away from reading this if you have. Dont use a == ever, unless you do so consciously!

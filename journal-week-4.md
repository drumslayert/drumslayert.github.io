###Journal week 4

#####I. Hello `HTML`
 Once upon a time, week 4 at the Iron Yard came along and HTML was a topic for the week. Silly me, I thought that It was going to be a lighter week. Then suddenly it was `html`, `Jquery`, `javascript` ,`css`, mvc, mocha, chai OMG I want to cry! It turned into a rough week of extremely long assignments. I need more time to practice reading and writing javascript so I dont have to stare at the screen for an hour before I can figure out what the heck is even happening. 

 Now I want to talk to you about chessboards, no, no, no, no, no, no, NO! Whose idea was this anyway? Chessboards are ment to be played on a table. That's final!  

 `Jquery` on the other hand, were starting to do more than just hold hands my friends. We are actually courting now and will soon be getting married. The `$`  is becoimng one of my best friends. Even if I don't predominately use `jquery` in my future carrer ahead, I feel it is slowly helping me to understand vanilla `javascript` better. It's like pseudocode on steriods.

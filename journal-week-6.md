## My halftime show

 Halftime week in some ways was a pleasant week, taking time to recap on everything weve been learning the past 6 weeks. On the filp-side though I'm just exhausted! My mind just wants a break from the chaos. I moved into a new level of just being tired all the time this week. I feel like I just want the final project to be here already so I can just work on one thing for a change instead of 50. At the same time, I can appreciate all the differnet things we are learning and getting are feet wet in, knowing it will come in handy later in "the real world". 
 
 Now this week wasn't only just a recap though. We were introduced to Lodash and how we can utilize it's fanciness in creating templates.  We also along with package.json's, we are now creating bower.json packages to help us build amazing applications for websites and more. Stay tuned for next week because Angular Js is coming.
 
 This week I made some progress on git. I'm able to get work done without creating merge conflicts or at least that are caused by me being neglectful. I've gotten quite a bit more comfortable on command-line and doing all my yak-shaving.  Creating all the new directories and files needed for each project. It goes by much faster now not having to use a finder window. I'm gaining some confidence in areas that I've still been sketchy on but I stll need lots and lots of practice reading, writing Javascript.

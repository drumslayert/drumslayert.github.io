      <p>My name is Terry Calhoun. Coding started as a hobby for me. A good friend introduced me to WordPress about 3 years ago and soon I began building websites for friends. I began attending conferences each year, and then it didnâ€™t take long to realize I wanted to turn this new-found passion into a career.
      </p>
      <p>In effort to educate myself further, I just spent three months immersed in a Front-End Engineering course at The Iron Yard in Durham. I worked really hard putting in 80-90 hours per week. I worked independently, in pairs and on teams. Our lectures and projects mostly consisted of learning and using technologies such as Javascript, jQuery, Angular js, Node js, Ajax, CSS, SASS, HTML5, APIâ€™s and the command-line. We used the Agile method utilizing github & morning stand-ups everyday and for every project. During our final project, we got very familiar with Trello as well. It helped tremendously as we planned out our milestones for each iteration to successfully build out a complete web application from scratch in just a short 2&1/2 week sprint.
      </p>
      <p>Today, Iâ€™m currently working as a Contract Developer with a company called Fan Base. They are located in Raleigh NC. I build new, update, add new content or repair broken sites in WordPress for new and existing clients.  Since working with Fan Base, I have also been introduced to basecamp, working with a team of great people from Coalmarch Tech.  When called upon from them, I also update, repair, build and add new content for their clientâ€™s WordPress sites.  Working with the team from Coalmarch has been a great experience for me. Itâ€™s allowed me to also be introduced to and use Pantheon. Which is yet another website management platform.</p>
      <p>I can honestly say, as scary it has been making such a big career shift, with a family of 4, two very young girls, selling just about everything we own practically, moved across several states and I willfully walked away from a great job of over 20 years in Tampa, FL. I truly have enjoyed the risk! ðŸ™‚  Itâ€™s forced me to step out of my comfort zones in every way. I have so much more to learn on this journey. Then so much more I want to learn just because!  Iâ€™m looking forward to meeting some great people that are willing to share their wealth of knowledge with me (a newbie).  I love technology!  I always have.  Iâ€™m creative!  A thinker!  A problem solver!  Most of all, everything about me boils down to, I truly enjoy helping people. ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m hoping to take all my years of working with business to business accounts, gaining and keeping new and old accounts, customer relationships with daily experience helping people solve their problems and bring that into the tech industry. I want to be a part of, design, develop and create real solutions to real problems and help share it with the world.

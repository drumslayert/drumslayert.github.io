##Week two @TheIronYard

 Heading into week two I felt like things were getting better. I had a few moments of clarity and where I felt like I could breathe. I felt like I was finally grasping how to use, read and write `Arrays` & `Objects`.  Suddenly my world was shattered as the `DOM` bomb was dropped.  I felt like it was my shock-and-awe of the week!  I immediately moved back to that spot in the comfort-zone circle just before complete panic zone.
 
 Taking most of the week to find my bearings in all of this new information, I still have a lot to grasp about the `DOM` but its coming in bits and pieces. I've definatlely made some headway in understanding program flow which is helping me understand functions more and more. I'm finding I have to literally disect each one to get real clarity on what and how its doing what its doing. 
 
 Taking everything into account from the past two weeks, Im learning more and more about myself and how I learn. Im realizing Im a very visual learner. So to see things mapped out in some sort of diagram is helping me make a little headway in certain areas. At the same time its very time consuming so struggling to find the balance of keeping up the pace is tough.

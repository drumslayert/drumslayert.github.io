Today I'm going to show you how to setup a bower.json package. Next week we will learn how to install dependencies. 

1. Open up your command line  
2. cd into the directory you wish to install your package.
3. Typr the following command after your prompt: $ bower init 
4. You will then be asked what you would like to name it. It will provide a suggestion based on the directory your in. Either hit enter to accept or type the name you want and then hit enter. 
5. Then you will be asked what version number you want. It will suggest 0.0.0. You can either accept or put the version you need.
6. Then you will be asked for a description: blah blah blah just type what you like. 
7. Then main file: index.html 
8. Then what types of modules does this package expose? You can choose from a list or ignore them all and move on. 
9. Then you you will be asked for any keywords.
10. Then who the author is?  Most of the time will suggest you since your the one creating it.
11. Then for a license: Please use one!
12. A Homepage:
13. If you want to set currently installed components as dependencies? yes/no
14. Add commonly ignored files to ignore list? yes/no
15. would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally published to the registry? yes/no
16. Then finally the last question  will be to review everything and say wether or not it looks good. Yes/no

That is all folks! You have officially created your first bower.json package. Please go celebrate, get yourself some icecream or something and then teach your new found knowledge to someone else. Thank you for trying tools with Terry

###Tools with Terry

Hey guys, welcome back! In this tutorial I'm going to show you step by step how to build a site wrapper "class" that 
 you can use, re-use, whatever you like. This will keep different sections in your website contained in a cute little 
 protective wrap if you will. An example would be if your header and main content are going to be the same width you 
 could set them both to the same class, style it once and be done. The best part is you get to take this amazing knowledge
 and apply it, customize it, re-use it, keep it forever and ever on all your future sites going forward. By the end of 
 this tutorial my friend, you will be a wizard!

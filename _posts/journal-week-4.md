###Journal week 4


 Once upon a time week 4 at the Iron Yard arrived and I thought to myself, "Sweet! HTML, It's going to be a lighter week". Then suddenly it was `html`, `Jquery`, `javascript` ,`css`, mvc, mocha, chai, OMG I want to cry! It turned into a "turn off the firehose" week with no shortage of extremely long assignments. I just wish I had more time to practice reading and writing javascript. Between the class time and the homework assignments, It literaly consumes my entire day and evening.

 It was later in the week we got introduced to the chessboard. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, NO!!! Whose idea was this anyway? Chessboards are ment to be played on a table. That's final!  

 `Jquery` on the other hand, were starting to do more than just hold hands my friends. We are actually courting now and will soon be getting married. The `$` is becoimng one of my best friends. Even if I don't predominately use `jquery` in my future carrer ahead, I feel it is slowly helping me to understand vanilla `javascript` better. It's like pseudocode on steriods.

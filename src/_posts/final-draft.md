##Week two @TheIronYard

 Heading into my second week here at the Iron yard, I felt like things were starting to make sense and I was finally 
 having some moments of clarity. I felt like I could breathe a little again. It was right about the time I started 
 to get a good grasp of `arrays` and `objects` and how you use them. It was right about this time my world 
 was suddenly shattered as the DOM bomb was dropped. It was my shock-and-awe of the week! I immediately moved 
 back to that spot in the comfort-zone circle just before you enter the complete panic zone.
 
 Taking most of the week to find my bearings in this new world of information, I still have a lot to grasp about the 
 DOM but its coming in bits and pieces. I've definatlely made some headway in understanding program flow which is 
 helping me understand functions more and more. I'm finding I have to literally disect each one if I want to get 
 some real clarity on what and how its doing what its doing. 
 
 So in reflection from the past two weeks, I'm actually learning a lot more about myself in how I learn best. I'm 
 realizing I am a very visual learner. So to see things mapped out in some sort of diagram, it's helping me make a 
 little headway in certain areas where Im still having trouble. At the same time its very time consuming sometimes 
 so I'm trying hard find that balance by starting to use some time managment in each section or task given to me in
 the homework assignments. Im looking forward to seeing improvements into this next week.

##Week 3 OMG!

  Week 3, aside from my world outside of the school getting way too rowdy for my taste, it was quite refreshing. Going over CSS, although at times it's like getting in a fight with a circle saw, I somehow love it even still. I've enjoyed reviewing CSS and learning about all the different selectors, properties, and attributes. For myself, I have found using tracer bullets has been very helpful in understanding what the heck is actually going on when writing CSS. <br>
  
  I did start to feel the sting of javascript again when we started to bring Jquery into the mix a little. Even with the small review that we did, I think I like the songs that hear Jquery singing. In my humble opinion, it kind of does for javascript, what sass does for css. Despite, it's luring temtations, I will try my best to grasp javascript more fully berfore I taste and see that Jquery is good! <br>
  
  It has been an Interesting week as well with the insanity project that was given over the weekend. Insane with all I had going on along with it. I felt like I couldnt get anything done. Everytime I started to work on it, something else would happen that demanded my attention. Im hoping to have a better week in week 4, but you never know what uncle dave has up his sleeve.  <br>

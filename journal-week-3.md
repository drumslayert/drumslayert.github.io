##Week 3 OMG!

  Aside from my world outside of the school getting way too rowdy for my taste, the last week at The Iron Yard was quite refreshing. Going over CSS, although at times it's like getting in a fight with a circle saw, I somehow love it even still. I've enjoyed going over CSS and learning more about all the different selectors, properties, and attributes. For myself, I have found using tracer bullets has been very helpful in understanding what the heck is actually going on when writing CSS. <br>
  
  I started to feel the sting of javascript again though when we brought Jquery into the mix a little. It was just a small taste, but I think I like the songs that hear Jquery singing. In my humble opinion, it seems like it does for javascript what sass does for css. Despite all of it's temtations though, I will try and refrain as much as possible from dipping my hands too far in the candy dish. I desire to get a much better understanding and grasp in javascript, before I taste and see that Jquery is good! <br>
  
  Well as I wrap up my thoughts reflecting on last week, it has definately been interesting. With the insanity project that was given over the weekend, everything that happened at home, I felt like I couldnt get anything done. Everytime I started to work on the assignment, something else would happen that demanded my attention. Im hoping to have a better week in week 4, but you never know what uncle dave has up his sleeve.  <br>

####Journal Week 5

  Its crazy, Im suppose to be reflecting about last week but this week is kicking my tail so bad I can't even remember what happen last week. Well lucky for me I took a few notes. It was an "IIFE" kind of week I "promise"! No really I learned some cool new tricks with jQuery, IIFE's and how a promise needs a then. It sounds like I cant speak english right now and your probably right. Try a mocha chai test on me and ask if you expect me to be been is that which and has have with at of same and see what you get. I will be.strictly.equal.to me!

 Let's talk about the chessboard. That little pain in my biscuit is like a little pit bull.  It refuses to let go of me! I finaly had to just figure out how to tame it. I at least, with some help figured out how to get three buttons working. My plan is to go back at the end of this course and master that little thorn in my side and make it cry and appologize to me for wrecking two weekends of my life. 
 
 In all seriousness though, as bad as it feels, even with all the lack of sleep, torturous assignments, I'm still learning. It may be slower than I want it to be, but I am learning and starting to understand things little by little. I'm moving forward in baby steps, much like were expected to approach these problems we face day to day.  
I fully expect to look back at the end of week 12 and me greatful for all the misery somehow. :)

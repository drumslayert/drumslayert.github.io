###How to Color Yo Font!

  In the amazing world of CSS you can style your websites and pages to look however you want. Just one of those options is choosing the color of your font. If learning how to color your font is what you are looking for, then you've come to the right place. If not, then please move on to the next tutorial because here you will learn how to, color yo font!  
 1. First things first, you need to PICK YO FONT! 
   * There are many fonts you can choose from so you do not have to settle for what's been given you. If you so choose to explore your options, I have included a link to google fonts where you will have more than you probably ever wanted to choose from.  (https://www.google.com/fonts)
 2. Now it's time to set that font so we can get to the good part of coloring yo font.
   * Lato, Calibri, Arial, sans-serif are few to speak of, did you pick one? If so, now the fun begins. In your CSS styles sheet, set your font family to your new found favorite. Here is an example of how this is done: 
   font-family: sans-serif;
 3. OK, now it's time to put some color on yo flipping piece of font. :)  What color do you want? Well, Im so glad you asked. I would choose the color purple! Why "the color purple" you ask? Well because, for one it was such a great movie. Secondly it's also Al_the_x's favorite color. But just incase you dont want to be sick awseome, here are some more colors to choose from. Here is a link where you can pick or even make a custom color you desire.(http://www.colorpicker.com) Once you have reached your desired choice, add the 6 digit code followed by the # and then place that in your CSS styles sheet. Here is an example of how to set that color code. Just below where you had set your font family type, place your color code in: color: #ffffff; the f's just represent the 6 didgit code you produced when picking your color. In case your still confused, it should look something like what I have written below.
 ```
   selctor {
   font-family: Arial;
   color: #ffffff;
   }
```

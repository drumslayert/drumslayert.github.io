##IRON YARD WEEK 1

####The wonderful world of `Javascript`

 Started out my first week learning the 4 primitive types in Javascript. The first one being `Null` which only has one vaule of "intetionally empty". The second being `Boolean` which only has two values, consisting of either `true` or `false`. The third one being `number` - 3.1459. All numbers in `Javascript` are floats by default. Then lastly a  `string`, which is a word, thing or string of words inside of quotes. When I enter bare words into a computer it does not understand it. There is an exception because, any bare word after var will be an identifier. Operators always have to oporans and an expression is anything I can value. An expression is also the result of an operation.

 I learned about `functions` which consist of three things: Inputs, outputs and side effects. Return is what you use to get stuff out of the function. Parameters is the stuff inside the parenthesis. Parameters are Identifiers I can use inside the "body" or the statements. Im still having a hard time grasping how to even begin writing functions but I feel like Im slowy grasping a little more each day.  

 Weve also spent a great deal of time trying to conquer github via the browser and on and through command line. I'm coming to learn I like it better through command line. I would have never thought that in the begining coming into this class, but after having used it both ways now I'm definatley prefering command line.  It also seems you have a lot more options and control over what you can do.
  
  Over all I've enjoyed the first week, even though it was probably the most intense and uncofortable thing Ive ever done. I'm recognizing the need to immerse myself in all of this new information over and over and again so it will become familiar and understandable so I can in return begin read and write programs successfully heading into the future.

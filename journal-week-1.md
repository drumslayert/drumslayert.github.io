##IRON YARD WEEK 1

####Delving into the wonderful world of `Javascript`

Started out my week learning the 4 primitive types. The null which only has one vaule od "intetionally empty". The Boolean which only has two values consisting of either true or false. The number - 3.1459. All numbers in `Javascript` are floats by default. Then lastly there is a string, which is word, thing or string of words inside quotes. When I enter bare words into a computer it doesnt understand. There is an exception though, any bare word after var would be an identifier. Operators always have to operans and an expression is anything I can value. An expression is also the result of an operation.

Functions have three things: Inputs, outputs and side effects. Return is what you use to get stuff out of the function. Parameters is the stuff inside the parenthesis. Parameters are Identifiers I can use inside the "body" or the statements. 

Weve also spent a great deal of time trying to conquer git hub via the browser and on in and through command line. I'm coming to learn I like it better through command line. I would have never thought that coming into this class but after having used it both ways. Im definatley prefering command line.  It also seems you have a lot more options and control.
